# TF-IDF Example in Swift

Implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm in Swift. TF-IDF is commonly used in _Machine Learning_. 
As a reference to the general details about TF-IDF you can see this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tfâ€“idf)

This project is intended as an experimental implementation adopting Swift's Protocols and Generics.

Relevant files are:

- __Tf-Idf.swift__: contains implementations
- __DocExample.swift__: contains a use case example (also adopting generics)
- __Tf_IdfTests.swift__: contains tests for the case example.
